To run your PHP-based "Project Management Tool" in Visual Studio Code (VS Code), set up a local development environment because PHP executes on a server. The simplest way is to use XAMPP, which includes Apache and MySQL. First, download and install XAMPP on apachefriends.org, boot it up, and start the Apache and MySQL services using the control panel. Next, copy your project files—such as addproject.component.php, dashboard.component.php —into a folder named project-management-tool inside XAMPP's htdocs folder (e.g., C:\xampp\htdocs\project-management-tool on Windows or /Applications/XAMPP/htdocs/project-management-tool on macOS). Set up the MySQL database by visiting http://localhost/phpmyadmin in the browser, creating a database named project_manager, and running the SQL scripts to set up tables (users, projects) and add sample data, ensuring you change the database credentials in your PHP files to your settings (default: root with no password). Open VS Code, go to File > Open Folder, and select your project folder; install the PHP Intelephense extension for better code support. Having Apache and MySQL running, open a browser and navigate to http://localhost/project-management-tool/index.php to see the app—login with sample credentials such as admin@example.com and password123 (having hashed the password in the database). Edit your files in VS Code and refresh the browser to see changes instantly, using XAMPP's server to render the dynamic front-end PHP. Alternatively, if you prefer a lightweight solution, install PHP manually, use its built-in server by running php -S localhost:8000 from your project folder in VS Code's terminal, and set up MySQL separately. Still, XAMPP simplifies the process of finding a complete solution.
